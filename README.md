# TaskTracker IOS

TaskTracker IOS is a simple task tracking app created to help me learn 
about IOS development. The app allows users to add tasks and delete them 
when complete. I created this app to learn about Xcode, storyboard IOS UI 
components, and how to use UITableView and UserDefault connections between 
view controllers.

## Features
- Add tasks with a title and description
- Mark tasks as complete and delete them
- Save tasks using UserDefault for persistent storage

## Getting Started

To get started with TaskTracker IOS, clone this repository to your local 
machine:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskTracker-IOS.git```

2. Open the project in Xcode and run it on a simulator or physical device. 
You should be able to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them.

## Contributing

welcome!
